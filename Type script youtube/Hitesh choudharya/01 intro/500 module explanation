1.  the syntax for using variable using tyep script is
    * let [variableName] [:enterType] = assigned value;


2. use 'export {}' to hide the error that is coming for 'can not declare scope variable'

3. example : let greeting : string = "Dilshan"
    * In the above example you can only assign the string value can not assign
      any other values except string like number,array,objects

    * when we using "greeting.toLoweCase()" this is the string method. Only shows the string
      methods (not a methods related to the numbers)

4. There is no equivalent type for int and float the all are the numbers


4. Type script is automatically inferred to assign value type whe we declare value and variable in single line
   For good practices do not need to annotate ":number" in the source code
